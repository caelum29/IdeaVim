# IdeaVim Configuration
For more information on configuring IdeaVim, you can read my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@dbilici/a-practical-ideavim-setup-for-intellij-idea-cf74222e7b45).
## Base Settings
This section of the configuration covers the fundamental settings that establish the basic behavior and appearance of IdeaVim in your JetBrains IDE. Below is a description of each setting included in this part of the configuration.

```
set scrolloff=10
set history=1000
set number relativenumber
set showmode
set showcmd
set smartcase
set incsearch
set hlsearch
set visualbell
```
- `set scrolloff=10` Keeps 10 lines visible above and below the cursor when scrolling, making it easier to maintain context while editing.
- `set history=1000` Increases the number of command-line history entries to 1000, allowing you to recall more previous commands.
- `set number relativenumber` Displays line numbers alongside relative line numbers, aiding in navigation and editing.
- `set showmode` Displays the current mode (e.g., insert, normal) in the command line, helping you keep track of your mode.
- `set showcmd` Shows partial commands in the command line as you type, providing visual feedback on your input.
- `set smartcase` Makes search case-insensitive unless an uppercase letter is used, balancing case sensitivity in searches.
- `set incsearch` Enables incremental search, highlighting matches as you type, which improves search efficiency.
- `set hlsearch` Highlights all matches of the search pattern, making it easier to locate search results in the text.
- `set visualbell` Uses a visual flash instead of an audible bell to indicate errors or alerts, reducing distraction.

### Clipboard Integration
```
set clipboard+=unnamed
```
`set clipboard+=unnamed` Allows Vim to use the system clipboard for copy and paste operations, facilitating seamless interaction with other applications.

### Leader Key
```
let mapleader="\<space>"
```
`let mapleader="\<space>"` Sets the space key as the leader key, which is used as a prefix for custom key mappings, making them more accessible.

### Default Behavior
```
set gdefault
```
`set gdefault` Automatically applies the global default flag to substitution commands, simplifying text replacement tasks.

### IdeaVim Specific Settings
```
set ideajoin
set ideamarks
set idearefactormode=normal
set ideastatusicon=gray
```
- `set ideajoin` Enables the join command specific to IdeaVim, which helps in joining lines in the editor.
- `set ideamarks` Activates IdeaVim-specific mark features, integrating Vim marks with the IDE’s navigation tools.
- `set idearefactormode=normal` Sets the default refactor mode to normal, controlling how refactor operations behave.
- `set ideastatusicon=gray` Configures the status icon color for IdeaVim, providing a visual indicator in the IDE.


## Plugin Settings
This section focuses on the plugins I’ve integrated with IdeaVim and how their settings are configured to enhance my coding workflow.

```
- `<C-h> (Ctrl + h)` Move to the pane to the left.
- `<C-l> (Ctrl + l)` Move to the pane to the right.
- `<C-k> (Ctrl + k)` Move to the pane above.
- `<C-j> (Ctrl + j)` Move to the pane below.

### Navigation Actions
```
nmap <C-i> <Action>(Back)
nmap <C-o> <Action>(Forward)
```
- `<C-i> (Ctrl + i)` Acts like the back button in the IDE, taking you to the previous location in the code.
- `<C-o> (Ctrl + o)` Acts like the forward button, taking you to the next location in the code after using the back action.

### Jump Between Methods
```
nmap [[ <Action>(MethodUp)
nmap ]] <Action>(MethodDown)
```
- `[[` Moves the cursor to the previous method in the code.
- `]]` Moves the cursor to the next method in the code.

### Visual Indentation
```
vnoremap < <gv
vnoremap > >gv
```
- `<` Decreases the indentation of the selected block of code and keeps the selection active for further adjustments.
- `>` Increases the indentation of the selected block of code and keeps the selection active for further adjustments.
